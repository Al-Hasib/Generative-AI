      "2. Multiply 10 by 5:\n",

      "   - Multiply each digit of the first number (10) by the second number (5).\n",
      "   - In this case, the only non-zero digit in the first number is the tens digit (1), so multiply that by 5.\n",
      "   - The result is 50.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Add 123 and 456:\n",
      "   - Write down the numbers one below the other, aligning the units place.\n",
      "   - Start adding from the rightmost column (units place). 3 + 6 = 9.\n",
      "   - Move to the next column (tens place). 2 + 5 = 7.\n",
