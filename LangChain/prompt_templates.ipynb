    "Prompt templates help to translate user input and parameters into instructions for a language model. This can be used to guide a model's response, helping it understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based output.Prompt Templates take as input a dictionary, where each key represents a variable in the prompt template to fill in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt Templates output a PromptValue. This PromptValue can be passed to an LLM or a ChatModel, and can also be cast to a string or a list of messages. The reason this PromptValue exists is to make it easy to switch between strings and messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**String PromptTemplates** : used to format a single string, and generally are used for simpler inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatPromptTemplates** : used to format a list of messages. These \"templates\" consist of a list of templates themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MessagesPlaceholder** :  responsible for adding a list of messages in a particular place. In the above ChatPromptTemplate, we saw how we could format two messages, each one a string. But what if we wanted the user to pass in a list of messages that we would slot into a particular spot? This is how you use MessagesPlaceholder."
